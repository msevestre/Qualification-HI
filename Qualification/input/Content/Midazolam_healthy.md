#### IV/PO model

Midazolam physiochemical properties and ADME parameters were incorporated from the model developed by Hanke, Frechen (5). **Table 1** presents the drug specific parameters of midazolam and the values used in the healthy adult IV/PO model.

The healthy PBPK model development was based on single dose IV and oral PK studies described in the OSP midazolam report (36) and by Hanke, Frechen (5). The studies involved a variety of doses, such as 0.05 mg/kg IV bolus, 1 mg solution to 40 mg tablet, etc.
