Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker that affects the movement of calcium into heart cells and blood vessels. As a result, it relaxes blood vessels and increases oxygen supply to the heart while reducing its workload. Nifedipine is used in the treatment of angina, high blood pressure, Raynaud’s phenomenon, and premature labour. 

In this section, the general ADME (**Table 1**), the healthy PBPK model source, and translation to a population with HI for nifedipine are described.

**Table 1. General ADME of nifedipine (45)**

| BCS classification | II |
| Linear kinetics    | Kinetics linear between 20-60 mg (46). |
| Plasma half-life   | 2 hours |
| fe,unchanged       | Urine: <0.1%. 60-80% recovered in urine as inactive water soluble metabolites and rest eliminated in feces as metabolites. |
| Bioavailability    | 56-77%. Almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. |
| Distribution       | Steady state vlume of distribution of 0.63-0.77 L/kg. 97% protein bound. |
| Metabolism         | Predominantely metabolized by CYP3A4. |
| Clearance          | 0.45 ± 0.1 L/h |

The nifedipine healthy PBPK model was based on the development by Dallmann, Ince (45) with an application of CYP3A4 metabolism. The model developed in healthy adults serves as the foundation when applying physiological changes endured with HI to simulate the PK of nifedipine across the disease spectrum.
