#### Oral model

With the drug-specific parameters fixed, the healthy PBPK model was translated to a HI-PBPK model. Stages of HI used in the simulations were defined by the Child-Pugh score. A population with Child-Pugh A, B, and C was created according to the patient demographics of the population enrolled by Brockmöller, Thomsen (29) (**Table 2**). The Child-Pugh scores were defined in this study.

**Table 2. HI population demographics for levetiracetam oral administration**

| **Study** | **Dose and administration** | **Cohort** | **N** | **Age (years)** | **Weight (kg)** |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| Brockmöller, Thomsen (29) | 1000 mg single dose PO | European male patients Child-Pugh A | 5 | 50 ± 8 | 89 ± 16 |
| Brockmöller, Thomsen (29) | 1000 mg single dose PO | European male patients Child-Pugh B | 6 | 53 ± 5 | 87 ± 12 |
| Brockmöller, Thomsen (29) | 1000 mg single dose PO | European male patients Child-Pugh C | 5 | 51 ± 6 | 74 ± 3 |

Simulated PK of levetiracetam administered as a 1000 mg oral single dose in patients with Child-Pugh A, B, and C are presented in **Figure 1**, **Figure 2**, and **Figure 3**, respectively. These population HI-PBPK simulations were evaluated against observed plasma concentration-time profiles from Brockmöller, Thomsen (29).
