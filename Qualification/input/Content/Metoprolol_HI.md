#### IV model

With the drug-specific parameters fixed, the healthy PBPK model was translated to a HI-PBPK model. Stages of HI used in the simulations were defined by the Child-Pugh score. A population with Child-Pugh A, B, and C was created according to the patient demographics of the population enrolled by Regårdh, Jordö (35) (**Table 2**). The Child-Pugh scores were not defined in these studies and limited clinical variabls were reported to fully assess Child-Pugh status. Based on the clinical variables that were reportd, the study population likely consisted of patients classified as Child-Pugh A and B.

| **Study** | **Dose and administration** | **Cohort** | **N** | **Age (years)** | **Weight (kg)** |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| Regårdh, Jordö (35) | 20 mg IV bolus | European female (50%) and male patients with Child-Pugh scores A and B | 10 | 50 ± 8 | 89 ± 16 |

Simulated PK of metoprolol administered as a single 20 mg IV bolus in patients with Child-Pugh A and B presented in **Figure 1** and **Figure 2**, respectively. An evaluation of predicted versus observed AUC<sub>∞</sub> from patients enrolled in Regårdh, Jordö (35) is presented in **Table 3**.

#### Oral model

Simulated PK of metoprolol administered as 50 mg oral single dose in patients with Child-Pugh A and B presented in **Figure 3** and **Figure 4**, respectively. An evaluation of predicted versus observed AUC<sub>∞</sub> from patients enrolled in Regårdh, Jordö (35) is presented in **Table 4**.
