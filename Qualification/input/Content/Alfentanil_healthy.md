#### IV model

Alfentanil physiochemical properties and ADME parameters were incorporated from the model developed by Hanke, Frechen (5). **Table 1** presents the drug specific parameters of alfentanil and the values used in the healthy adult IV model.

The healthy PBPK model development was based on single dose IV PK studies described in the OSP alfentanil report (4) and Hanke, Frechen (5). These doses consisted of 0.015 mg/kg, 0.02 mg/kg, 0.05 mg/kg, and 1 mg/kg.
