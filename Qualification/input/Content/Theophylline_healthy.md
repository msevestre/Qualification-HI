#### IV model

Theophylline physiochemical properties and ADME parameters were incorporated from the model developed by Britz, Hanke (12). **Table 1** presents the drug specific parameters of theophylline and the values used in the healthy adult IV model.

The healthy PBPK model development was based on single or multiple dose IV PK studies described by Britz, Hanke (12). These doses consisted of 2.37 mg/kg to 426.6 mg.
