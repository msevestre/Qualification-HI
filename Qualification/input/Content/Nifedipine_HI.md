#### Oral model

With the drug-specific parameters fixed, the healthy PBPK model was translated to a HI-PBPK model. Stages of HI used in the simulations were defined by the Child-Pugh score. The study by Ene and Roberts (47) was used to evaluate the HI-PBPK model with oral administration (**Table 2**). A population with Child-Pugh A, B, and C was created according to the patient demographics of the population enrolled by Ene and Roberts (47). The Child-Pugh scores were not defined in these studies, and thus reported information such as plasma albumin concentrations, total bilirubin, etc. were used to classify. 

**Table 2. HI population demographics for nifedipine oral administration**

| **Study** | **Dose and administration** | **Cohort** | **N** | **Age (years)** | **Weight (kg)** |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| Ene and Roberts (47) | 10 mg single dose PO | European male patients with estimated Child-Pugh scores A-C | 7 | 60.7 [Range: 52-72] | 76.3 [Range: 64-90] |

Simulated AUC<sub>∞</sub> and Cmax of nifedipine administered as an 10 mg single oral dose in patients with Child-Pugh A, B, and C were compared to observed PK parameters from patients enrolled in Ene and Roberts (47) is presented in **Table 3**.
