#### Oral model

With the drug-specific parameters fixed, the healthy PBPK model was translated to a HI-PBPK model. Stages of HI used in the simulations were defined by the Child-Pugh score. A population with Child-Pugh A, B, and C was created according to the patient demographics of the population enrolled by Desmond, Patwardhan (20) and Lewis and Rector (21) (**Table 2**). The Child-Pugh scores were not defined in these studies, and thus reported information such as plasma albumin concentrations, total bilirubin, and prothrombin time were used to classify.

**Table 2. HI population demographics for caffeine oral administration**

| **Study** | **Dose and administration** | **Cohort** | **N** | **Age (years)** | **Weight (kg)** |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| Desmond, Patwardhan (20) | 250 mg oral solution | American male patients with Child-Pugh scores A-C | 10 | 42-65 | 67-90 |
| Lewis and Rector (21) | 300 mg oral solution | Group I: Patients with Child-Pugh A-C; Group II: Patients with Child Pugh A-C | Group I: 23 (A: 10, B: 7, and C: 6); Group II: 11 (B: 3 and C: 8) | Group I: 28-65; Group II: 30-63 | Group I: 57-102, Group II: 44-116 |

The population HI-PBPK simulations were evaluated against representative patients classified as moderate and severe liver disease as per Desmond, Patwardhan (20). Simulated PK of caffeine administered as a 250 mg oral solution in patients with Child-Pugh A, B, and C are presented in **Figure 1**, **Figure 2**, and **Figure 3**, respectively. An evaluation of predicted versus observed clearances from all patients enrolled in Desmond, Patwardhan (20) is presented in **Table 3**. 

**Table 3. Evaluation of caffeine oral HI-PBPK model-predicted vs observed clearance from Desmond, Patwardhan (20)**

| **Study** | **Predicted clearance (mL/min/kg)** | **Observed clearance (mL/min/kg)** | **Fold-error** |
|--|--|--|--|
| Desmond, Patwardhan (20), Control | 1.59 | 1.4 ± 0.5 | 1.14 |
| Desmond, Patwardhan (20), HI population | Child-Pugh A: 0.74; B: 0.23; C: 0.06 | 0.9 ± 0.3 | A: 0.82; B: 0.26; C: 0.07 |

Lewis and Rector (21) conducted a PK study with the purpose of describing the PK of caffeine in two groups of patients with HI. Group I included patients with mild to moderate liver disease, while Group II consisted of hospitalized patients with moderate to severe HI. HI-PBPK simulations were conducted for each group, with Group I including virtual individuals with Child-Pugh A-C and Group II including virtual individuals with Child-Pugh B and C. Model performance was evaluated by comparing predicted to observed clearance (**Table 4**).
