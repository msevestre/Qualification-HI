Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that acts to reduce the amount of acid in the stomach. It is commonly used to prevent and treat stomach ulcers, and to treat indigestion, heartburn, and acid reflux. 

In this section, the general ADME (**Table 1**), the healthy PBPK model source, and translation to a population with HI for omeprazole are described.

**Table 1. General ADME of omeprazole (48, 49)**

| BCS classification | II |
| Linear kinetics    | At higher doses exhibits non-linear kinetics. |
| Plasma half-life   | <1 hour |
| fe,unchanged       | No unchanged omeprazole found in urine nor feces (50). |
| Bioavailability    | 40%. Absorption takes place in the small intestine and usually completed within 3-6 hours. |
| Distribution       | Apparent volume of distribution is 0.3 L/kg. 97% plasma protein bound. |
| Metabolism         | Primarily metabolized by CYP2C19. Also metabolized by CYP3A4. |
| Clearance          | 80% of oral dose excreted as metabolites in urine. Remainder of dose excreted in feces, primarily from bile secretion. |

The omeprazole healthy PBPK model was based on the development by Kanacher, Lindauer (49) with an application of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 metabolism, and renal clearance. The model developed in healthy adults serves as the foundation when applying physiological changes endured with HI to simulate the PK of omeprazole across the disease spectrum.
