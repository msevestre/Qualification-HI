#### IV model

With the drug-specific parameters fixed, the healthy PBPK model was translated to a HI-PBPK model. Stages of HI used in the simulations were defined by the Child-Pugh score. A population with Child-Pugh B and C was created according to the patient demographics of the population enrolled by Ferrier, Marty (10) (**Table 2**). The Child-Pugh scores were not defined in Ferrier, Marty (10), and thus reported information such as plasma albumin concentrations and total bilirubin were used to classify.

**Table 2. HI population demographics for alfentanil IV administration**

| **Study** | **Dose and administration** | **Cohort** | **N** | **Age (years)** | **Weight (kg)** |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| Ferrier, Marty (10) | 0.05 mg/kg IV bolus | HI population: European females (45%) and males with estimated Child-Pugh B and C | 11 | 56 [range: 39-69] | 60 [range: 43-73] |
| Ferrier, Marty (10) | 0.05 mg/kg IV bolus | Control population: European | 10 | 45 [range: 25-66] | 59 [range: 34-84] |

Simulated PK of alfentanil after a single IV bolus dose of 0.05 mg/kg in patients with Child-Pugh B and C are presented in **Figure 1** and **Figure 2**, repectively. Simulations of the average healthy control are included for comparison.
