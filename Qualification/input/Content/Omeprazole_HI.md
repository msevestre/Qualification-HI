#### IV model

With the drug-specific parameters fixed, the healthy PBPK model was translated to a HI-PBPK model. Stages of HI used in the simulations were defined by the Child-Pugh score. A population with Child-Pugh A, B, and C was created according to the patient demographics of the population enrolled by Andersen, Olsson (51) and Piqué, Feu (52) (**Table 2**). 

**Table 2. HI population demographics for omeprazole IV administration**

| **Study** | **Dose and administration** | **Cohort** | **N** | **Age (years)** | **Weight (kg)** |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| Andersen, Olsson (51) | 20 mg IV infusion over 5 min single dose | European female (50%) and male patients with Child-Pugh scores A, B, and C | A: 3; B: 4; C: 1 | 40-80 | 56-119 |
| Piqué, Feu (52) | 80 mg bolus over 30 min followed by a continuous infusion of 8 mg/h for 47.5 hours | European female (62%) and male patients with Child-Pugh scores A, B, and C | A: 5; B: 4; C: 4 | 38-74 | Not reported |

Simulated PK of omeprazole administered as 20 mg IV infusion over 5 min in patients with Child-Pugh A, B, and C presented in **Figure 1**, **Figure 2**, and **Figure 3**, respectively. An evaluation of predicted versus observed clearance from patients enrolled in Andersen, Olsson (51) is presented in **Table 3**.

| Andersen, Olsson (51), Control | 290.85 | 594 ± 50 | 0.49 |
| Andersen, Olsson (51), HI population | Child-Pugh A: 137.74; B: 116.15; C: 72.94 | 67 ± 5 | A: 2.06; B: 1.72; C: 1.09 |

The comparison of observed PK from Piqué, Feu (52) versus simulated PK of omeprazole administered as 80 mg bolus over 30 min followed by a continuous infusion of 8 mg/h for 47.5 hours in patients with Child-Pugh A, B, and C is presented in **Figure 4**, **Figure 5**, and **Figure 6**, respectively.

#### Oral model

Evaluation of the oral model used observed data from Rinetti, Regazzi (53)(**Table 4**). Based on limited clinical data presented, it was estimated that patients with Child-Pugh A-C were enrolled.

**Table 4. HI population demographics for omeprazole oral administration**

| **Study** | **Dose and administration** | **Cohort** | **N** | **Age (years)** | **Weight (kg)** |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| Rinetti, Regazzi (53) | 20 mg single oral dose | European female (25%) and male patients with estimated Child-Pugh scores A, B, and C | 8 | 26-42 | 52-93 |

Simulated PK of omeprazole administered as 20 mg oral single dose in patients with Child-Pugh A, B, and C presented in **Figure 7**, **Figure 8**, and **Figure 9**, respectively. An evaluation of predicted versus observed AUC<sub>∞</sub> and Cmax from patients enrolled in Rinetti, Regazzi (53) is presented in **Table 5**.
