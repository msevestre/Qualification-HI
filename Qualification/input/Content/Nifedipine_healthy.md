#### Oral model

Nifedipine physiochemical properties and ADME parameters were incorporated from the model developed by Dallmann, Ince (45). **Table 1** presents the drug specific parameters of nifedipine and the values used in the healthy adult oral model.

The healthy PBPK model development was based on oral PK studies with 10 or 20 mg capsule administration as described in Dallmann, Ince (45).
