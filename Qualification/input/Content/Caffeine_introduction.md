Caffeine is a methylxanthine derivative that has a wide variety of clinical and non-clinical uses. Administration of oral and IV caffeine can be seen in the clinical setting.

In this section, the general ADME (**Table 1**), the healthy PBPK model source, and translation to a population with HI for caffeine are described.

**Table 1. General ADME of caffeine (11, 12)**

| BCS classification | I |
| Linear kinetics    | Yes, over 50, 300, 500, and 750 mg doses (13) |
| Plasma half-life   | 5 hours (14, 15) |
| fe,unchanged       | Urine: <3% (16). Once it is filtered by the glomeruli, only a small percentage is excreted unchanged in urine. |
| Bioavailability    | 108.3% Â± 3.6% (17) |
| Distribution       | Average volume of distribution after oral administration is 0.7 L/kg (18). Fraction unbound of 70% in healthy volunteers (16). |
| Metabolism         | Almost exclusively metabolized by CYP1A2 (16). |
| Clearance          | 0.078 L/h/kg (14, 15). Likely that metabolism rather than renal processes of caffeine is rate limiting in its clearance (19). |

The caffeine healthy PBPK model was based on the development by Britz, Hanke (12) with an application of CYP1A2 metabolism and glomerular filtration. The model developed in healthy adults serves as the foundation when applying physiological changes endured with HI to simulate the PK of caffeine across the disease spectrum.
