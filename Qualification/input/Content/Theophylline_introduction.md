Theophylline is a methylxanthine that is administer either orally or intravenously for the management of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (60). Theophylline induces its bronchodilatory effects through antagonism and inhibition of the adenosine and phosphodiesterase pathways, respectively (61, 62).

In this section, the general ADME (**Table 1**), the healthy PBPK model source, and translation to a population with HI for theophylline are described.

**Table 1. General ADME of theophylline (12, 63)**

| BCS classification | N/A |
| Linear kinetics    | Potentially exhibiting non-linear kinetics at very high doses (64) |
| Plasma half-life   | IV: 4.8-6.7 hours (65) |
| fe,unchanged       | Urine: 14-17% (65) |
| Bioavailability    | N/A |
| Distribution       | Average volume of distribution in patients receiving analgesia with alfentanil is 0.5 L/h/kg (65). Fraction unbound: 0.28 (66). |
| Metabolism         | Metabolized by CYP1A2 and CYP2E1 (65). |
| Clearance          | IV: 0.057-0.072 L/h/kg (65). |

The theophylline healthy PBPK model is reported in the OSP theophylline report (63) and was based on the development by Britz, Hanke (12) with an application of CYP1A2 and CYP2E1 metabolism, and renal clearance by glomerular filtration. The model developed in healthy adults serves as the foundation when applying physiological changes endured with HI to simulate the PK of theophylline across the disease spectrum.
