#### IV model

Omeprazole physiochemical properties and ADME parameters were incorporated from the model developed by Kanacher, Lindauer (49). **Table 1** presents the drug specific parameters of omeprazole and the values used in the healthy adult IV model.

The healthy PBPK model development was based on multiple IV PK studies with 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg dosing schedules described in the OSP omeprazole report (48) and by Kanacher, Lindauer (49).

#### Oral model

The healthy PBPK model development was based on multiple oral PK studies described in the OSP omeprazole report (48) and by Kanacher, Lindauer (49). Absorption parameters in the oral model included omeprazole capsule described by a Weibull distribution with dissolution half-time of 41.65 min, lag time of 30 min, and shape 1.02.
