#### IV model

Metoprolol physiochemical properties and ADME parameters were incorporated from the model developed by Rüdesheim, Wojtyniak (31). **Table 1** presents the drug specific parameters of metoprolol and the values used in the healthy adult IV model.

The healthy PBPK model development was based on multiple IV PK studies described in the OSP metoprolol report (30) and by Rüdesheim, Wojtyniak (31).

#### Oral model

The healthy PBPK model development was based on multiple oral PK studies described in the OSP metoprolol report (30) and by Rüdesheim, Wojtyniak (31). Absorption parameters in the oral model included metoprolol tartate tablet described by a Weibull distribution with dissolution half-tim of 12.31 min and shape 0.72.
