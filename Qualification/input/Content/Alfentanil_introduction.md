Alfenatanil is a potent, synthetic opioid used to provide analgesia for various surgical procedures and in patients admitted within intensive care units. Alfentanil is typically administered intravenously and offers several advantages to alternative analgesics due to its potency at the opioid receptor and quick onset of effect (3).

In this section, the general absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) (**Table 1**), the healthy PBPK model source, and translation to a population with HI for alfentanil are described.

**Table 1. General ADME of alfentanil (4, 5)**

| BCS classification | N/A |
| Linear kinetics    | Potentially exhibiting non-linear kinetics at very high doses (6) |
| Plasma half-life   | IV: 1.59 hours (6) |
| fe,unchanged       | Urine: <1% (7) |
| Bioavailability    | N/A |
| Distribution       | Average volume of distribution in patients receiving analgesia with alfentanil is 0.75 L/h/kg (5). Highly protein bound (90%). IV: 27.2 L (6). |
| Metabolism         | Metabolized exclusively by CYP3A4 (8) |
| Clearance          | Not a substrate for P-gp (9). IV: 14.3 L/h (6). |

The alfentanil healthy PBPK model is reported in the OSP alfentanil report (4) and was based on the development by Hanke, Frechen (5) with an application of CYP3A4 metabolism and glomerular filtration. The model developed in healthy adults serves as the foundation when applying physiological changes endured with HI to simulate the PK of alfentanil across the disease spectrum.
