Levetiracetam is an antiepileptic used for the treatment of patients with partial seizures, with or without secondary generalization (22, 23). The mechanism of antiseizure activity has not been fully elucidated, however, animal models have shown that levetiracetam binds to synaptic vescle proteins SV2A modulating neurotransporter release (24).

In this section, the general ADME (**Table 1**), the healthy PBPK model source, and translation to a population with HI for levetiracetam are described.

**Table 1. General ADME of levetiracetam (25)**

| BCS classification | I |
| Linear kinetics    | Linear up to a dose of 5,000 mg (26) |
| Plasma half-life   | 6-8 hours |
| fe,unchanged       | Urine: 66% (22, 27) |
| Bioavailability    | >95% (28) |
| Distribution       | Volume of distribution in healthy individuals is 0.5-0.7 L/kg. Almost exclusively unbound in plasma (97%) (22) |
| Metabolism         | Does not involve the cytochrome P450 system as th major metabolic pathway involves enzymatic hydrolysis within the blood (22, 28). |
| Clearance          | Renal excretion (22) |

The levetiracetam healthy PBPK model was based on the development by Sinha, Karatza (25) with an application of esterase activity in blood and glomerular filtration. The model developed in healthy adults serves as the foundation when applying physiological changes endured with HI to simulate the PK of levetiracetam across the disease spectrum.
