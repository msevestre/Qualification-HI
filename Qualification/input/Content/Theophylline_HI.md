#### IV model

With the drug-specific parameters fixed, the healthy PBPK model was translated to a HI-PBPK model. Stages of HI used in the simulations were defined by the Child-Pugh score. A population with Child-Pugh B and C was created according to the patient demographics of the population enrolled by Froomes, Morgan (67) (**Table 2**). 

**Table 2. HI population demographics for theophylline IV administration**

| **Study** | **Dose and administration** | **Cohort** | **N** | **Age (years)** | **Weight (kg)** |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| Froomes, Morgan (67) | 3 mg/kg IV infusion over 10 min | HI population: European females (40%) and males with Child-Pugh B and C | B: 3; C: 7 | 47.5 [range: 39-64] | Not reported |

Froomes, Morgan (67) observed versus simulated clarance and half-life of theophylline after a 3 mg/kg IV infusion over 10 min in patients with Child-Pugh B and C are presented in **Table 3**. 

| **Study** | **Predicted clearance (mL/min)** | **Observed clearance (mL/min)** | **Fold-error** | **Predicted half-life (h)** | **Observed half-life (h)** | **Fold-error** |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| Froomes, Morgan (67), Child-Pugh B | 26.48 [Range: 14.16-54.58] | 19.03 [Range: 13.4-23.9] | 1.39 | 23.39 | 23 ± 10 | 1.02 |
| Froomes, Morgan (67), Child-Pugh C | 6.5 [Range: 2.64-13.33] | 27.98 [Range: 19.8-35] | 0.23 | 44.08 | 23 ± 10 | 1.92 |
