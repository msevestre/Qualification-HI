#### Oral model

With the drug-specific parameters fixed, the healthy PBPK model was translated to a HI-PBPK model. Stages of HI used in the simulations were defined by the Child-Pugh score. Muirhead, Wilner (59) was used to evaluate the HI-PBPK model with oral administration (**Table 2**). 

A population with Child-Pugh A and B was created according to the patient demographics of the population enrolled by Muirhead, Wilner (59). The study included patients with biopsy confirmd hepatic cirrhosis classified with Child-Pugh A and B.

**Table 2. HI population demographics for sildenafil oral administration**

| **Study** | **Dose and administration** | **Cohort** | **N** | **Age (years)** | **Weight (kg)** |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| Muirhead, Wilner (59) | 50 mg oral single dose | American male patients with Child-Pugh scores A and B | A: 7; B: 5 | 32-63 | Not reported |

Simulated PK of sildenafil administered as a 50 mg oral single dose in patients with Child-Pugh A and B are presented in **Figure 1** and **Figure 2**, respectively. An evaluation of predicted versus observed AUC<sub>∞</sub> and Cmax from patients enrolled in Muirhad, Wilner (59) is presented in **Table 3**.
